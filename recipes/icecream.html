        <h1> Description </h1>
        <p>
            Thai green curry, known as "Gaeng Keow Wan" in Thai, is a delightful and aromatic dish that is a staple in Thai cuisine. It is a rich and creamy curry made with a flavorful green curry paste, coconut milk, and a variety of fresh ingredients. The green curry paste is the heart of this dish and is made from ingredients such as green chilies, lemongrass, garlic, and various aromatic herbs and spices, giving it a vibrant green color and a complex, spicy-sweet flavor. This paste is then simmered with coconut milk, which imparts a luxurious creaminess to the dish.

            In addition to the curry base, Thai green curry typically includes a variety of proteins, such as chicken, shrimp, or tofu, along with an assortment of vegetables like bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and Thai eggplants. The result is a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, with the heat from the chilies balanced by the soothing coconut milk. Thai green curry is often served with steamed jasmine rice, creating a comforting and satisfying meal that showcases the wonderful balance of flavors that Thai cuisine is known for. Its combination of spiciness, creaminess, and the freshness of the ingredients makes it a favorite among both Thai food enthusiasts and those new to the cuisine.
